# Optimizing images

```
npm run compressImage
```

Output will look like this...

```javascript
PS E:\projects\Findly\findly-builder> npm run compressImage

> findly-builder@0.0.0 compressImage
> node tools/scripts/compress-image.js

If all images optimized you may get this....

```js
PS E:\projects\Findly\findly-builder> npm run compressImage

> findly-builder@0.0.0 compressImage
> node tools/scripts/compress-image.js

-------------
null
true
undefined

PS E:\projects\Findly\findly-builder>
```

**Note**

You want to place any new image inside `images-source` folder maintaining same folder structure.

## Dirty trick ( if you Don't want to create deep folder structure)

Place all new images in a folder inside `images-source` run `npm run compressImage` it will generate optimized images now you want to manually copy paste images in intended folder, Don't forget to remove new folder you created inside `images-source` directory.


**Note**: as deployment failing so removing these ( add back before optimizing )
