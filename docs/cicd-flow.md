# Bitbucket CI/CD

Checkout: The CI/CD pipeline starts by checking out the source code from your version control system (such as Git) to a build agent or container.

Dependencies: Install or update any dependencies required for your project. This may involve pulling dependencies from a package manager like npm or pip.

Linting: Run the linter on your source code to check for code style violations and potential errors. Linting helps ensure consistent code quality across your project. You can use tools like ESLint, Pylint, or RuboCop depending on your programming language.

Testing: Run your automated tests to verify that your code functions as expected. This may include unit tests, integration tests, or end-to-end tests. You can use testing frameworks specific to your programming language or tools like Jest, Pytest, or Selenium.

Code Coverage: Optionally, calculate code coverage to measure how much of your code is being exercised by the tests. Tools like Istanbul, coverage.py, or JaCoCo can generate code coverage reports.

Build: If your project requires building or compiling, perform this step in the pipeline. For example, if you have a web application, you might transpile JavaScript, compile SCSS, or bundle assets. This step prepares your code for deployment.

Artifact Creation: Create any artifacts or packages that need to be deployed or released. This could be a Docker image, a JAR file, or a ZIP archive.

Deployment: Deploy the artifacts to the desired environment, such as staging or production. This step will vary based on your project's architecture and deployment strategy. It could involve deploying to cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud, or pushing to a container registry.

Post-deployment Testing: Optionally, run additional tests or checks on the deployed application to ensure it is functioning correctly in the target environment. This might include smoke tests, API tests, or user interface tests.

Notifications and Reports: Notify relevant stakeholders about the build and deployment status. You can send email notifications or integrate with communication platforms like Slack. Generate reports and metrics that summarize the pipeline's results.
