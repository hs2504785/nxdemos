# Intersection Observer

The Intersection Observer API is a web platform API that allows you to asynchronously observe changes in the intersection of a target element with an ancestor element or with the viewport in a performant way, without needing to poll for changes or use the less efficient scroll event. It is often used in Angular applications to implement lazy loading of content or to trigger animations when an element becomes visible.
